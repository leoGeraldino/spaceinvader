<h1>Welcome to the Space Invader game!</h1>

Are you ready for fun?<br>
So, before we continue, I need to explain some things to you...

<h2>How to play</h2>

After you download the repository, you must find the file called <b>spaceinvader.py</b>. You open and run it, so a new window called <i>Space Invader</i> will open.<br>
To control the spaceship, press the keys <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd> on the keyboard, to move the ship to the left and to the right, respectivelly. <br> To shot against the aliens, you must press the keyboard space bar.
Be carefully! When an alien comes to the same row that the spaceship be, you'll lost and it be a game over. <br>
At this point, the game doesn't have a try again button
